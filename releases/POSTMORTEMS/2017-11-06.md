# Postmortem 2017-11-06

## Completed Releases
## Release: Firefox 56.0.2 2017-10-24

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- rail: The updates builder failed because we had to partials for version less than 56.0, so the bz2 blob top-level submission failed. Fixed in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1395697#c48 and has been rerun.
- jlund: REQUIREMENT: determine need and action - [Bug 1411428](https://bugzil.la/1411428) - Create partial updates to migrate eligible 56.0 win32 users to 56.0.2 win64
- jlund: REQUIREMENT: update balrog rules to reflect requirements defined in this [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_b3SuHiMZn141jM_MHw9sclm8nkn_COrlbHF44NIWKY/edit\#heading\=h.g14w5uu682r0)
- jlund: REQUIREMENT: re: balrog rules - all users should watershed off 56.0. https://aus4-admin.mozilla.org/rules/624  stays the same
- jlund: REQUIREMENT: re: balrog rules - no users receive 56.0.1. If we need migration partials from [Bug 1411428](https://bugzil.la/1411428), we should update https://aus4-admin.mozilla.org/rules/659 to point to 56.0.2 with WNP for mobile promotion. Same WNP as 56.0.1
- jlund: REQUIREMENT: re: balrog rules - all platforms + non eligible win32 migration 56.0 users should go to 56.0.2 with WNP for mobile promotion. Same WNP as 56.0.1
- jlund: REQUIREMENT: re: balrog rules - all 56.0.1 users should receive 56.0.2 but *not* receive any WNP as they already saw WNP for mobile promotion
- jlorenzo: [Bug 1411981](https://bugzil.la/1411981) - Can't schedule publishing in balrog: balrog-release-shipper.py: error: unrecognized arguments: --suffix
- jlorenzo: I worked around [Bug 1411981](https://bugzil.la/1411981) by manually submitting J5nLeOoORmu1Hm9pYg0Hdw (with "publish_bz2_blob" set to false in the payload). Then I forced the original task to be resolved.

- nthomas: mac signing server timeouts hit 2 locales in mac repacks (YH8_OPgpSTSfv6X2c4lsFQ, VLEvinNvRzy2htF1BqWfYg) and artifacts tasks (Cq8Q1gGaTLy3Z9w2PWWjWQ, d82MRzy7SbefU9hz2zla1w). Possibly overall signing load for dep & nightly & release, reran tasks
- jlorenzo: Reran VkfovhwiRSGzRbGpjGO18Q for intermittent download error. https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/devedition/releases/57.0b11/win32/kab/Firefox Setup 57.0b11.exe wasn't available on the CDN

- jlorenzo: Reran YhWJ1MTdRAWUQpr-V1tQWg for intermittent download error. http://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/candidates/57.0b12-candidates/build2/update/win32/gd/firefox-57.0b12.complete.mar didn't have the right size. I downloaded manually and checked the file was correct on my end
- jlorenzo: YhWJ1MTdRAWUQpr-V1tQWg hung for another download error: <class 'twisted.internet.error.ConnectionLost'>: Connection to the other side was lost in a non-clean fashion. I reran it. While the job was still running, I shipped the release because this failure remains infra-related

## Release: Devedition 57.0b13 2017-10-30

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- jlorenzo: https://tools.taskcluster.net/groups/Z6Mm0ryySGGaDCmswoUIKA/tasks/SMGhnnDVQxK_UdBgwyJY6w/runs/0/logs/public%2Flogs%2Flive_backing.log.gz failed because no release_eta was set in ship-it. I manually created U0wFN1-3SbKeR2IvELVnpw and manually resolved the original one. I5o0elGPSs2WdTkEHT35mQ is a casualty: we shouldn't introduce 'release_eta' in task.payload.properties anymore, but 'schedule_at', instead
- jlorenzo: UV test f5UXs_B1SUO82IpmVXckTw has been running for 11+ hours. I suspect somthing went wrong in BBB. I reran the task, but after we shipped that release.


## Release: Firefox 57.0b13 2017-10-30

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- jlund: bbb was wedged. failed win repack and updates builder failed to retry in bb because bbb didn't tell tc about failed run0. [Bug 1409445](https://bugzil.la/1409445) for updates builder issue and [Bug 1413025](https://bugzil.la/1413025) for bbb wedging
- jlorenzo: 4 signing tasks remained pending after waiting for 1+ hour. It turned out jamun was taking 7 out of 8 signing-worker-v1 (in Or3X9v9vS3yR0o4UzUflNA). I cancelled the tasks there, then b13 resumed. Note: signing-worker-v1 finishes its job even though the task was cancelled on the TC-side.
