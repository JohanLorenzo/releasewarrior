## Release: Thunderbird 57.0b1 2017-11-06

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- SPECIAL REQUIREMENT: Verify that the patches identified for thunderbird in [Bug 1397721](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1397721#c17) has landed and reconfigured.
- POTENTIAL ISSUE: Cross-Channel L10n new in this release, should use l10n-central repo. See [Bug 1397721](https://bugzil.la/1397721)
- callek: [Bug 1414939](https://bugzil.la/1414939) - Filed because of failed release sanity for TB 57.0b1, this is because we didn't land the patch to enable l10n-central.
- nthomas: release-comm-beta-thunderbird_push_to_mirrors ran, but failed early and didn't have any effect. Probably the very rare scheduling strangeness we've never been able to pin down in buildbot releases
- callek: Hit a bunch of different l10n issues tracked in  [Bug 1415057](https://bugzil.la/1415057), [Bug 1415058](https://bugzil.la/1415058), [Bug 1415064](https://bugzil.la/1415064). Will require a build2

- POTENTIAL ISSUE: Cross-Channel L10n new in this release, should use l10n-central repo. See [Bug 1397721](https://bugzil.la/1397721)
- SPECIAL REQUIREMENT: Block updates for users with old JAWS software using the 'JAWS Screen Reader Compatibility' boolean on Balrog rules. See bugs 1402376, 1402411
- nthomas: win32 EME repacks (LH5h1BHURBuFZuQ87yt4kg) had a '3600 seconds without output' hang, rerun
- nthomas: release update verify 4,5,6,7,8/12 failed due to expecting 56.0 to be offered 57.0 instead of 56.0.2. We need to set up release-localtest.
- callek: update verify possibly fixable by [Bug 1415557](https://bugzil.la/1415557) now that rules are setup.
- callek: [Bug 1415276](https://bugzil.la/1415276) - Unable to publish to beta channel: KeyError: 'bz2_blob_suffix'
- callek: Due to [Bug 1415276](https://bugzil.la/1415276) manually inspected that the rc was published to balrog.
- bhearsum: Backed out [Bug 1415172](https://bugzil.la/1415172) because chunked update verify doesn't support multiple 'to' versions in the same config
- bhearsum: Another round of fixes in [Bug 1415557](https://bugzil.la/1415557) to work around issues with SYSTEM_CAPABILITIES and update verify

## Release: Devedition 58.0b2 2017-11-10

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- callek: Had to manually land the version_display.txt bump due to no bump existing, and revised the ship-it revision. Landed on both 'default' and a used relbranch because we were explicitly not taking tip of default for this beta.
- nthomas: Canceled mark as shipped task (c8c1mB8kRZiD-0p5M6k-ag) because we elected to not deploy [Bug 1415288](https://bugzil.la/1415288) in the change freeze
- nthomas: [Bug 1416053](https://bugzil.la/1416053) - new locale ne-NP not getting offers of partial update from 58.0b1, breaking update verify and final verify on all platforms. Adjust Devedition-58.0b1-build1, and rerun
- nthomas: win64 l10n repack 10/10 (SCuadzcTSC2XE2pRknKnLA) was perma pending (on Run 1) even though the artifacts task was done. Possible some message got lost after AWS price spikes and buildbot retries. Marked completed
