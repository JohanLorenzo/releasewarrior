# ReleaseDuty Statement of Work / Overview

ReleaseDuty is a duty cycle where an engineer is responsible for operational
tasks related to releasing new versions of Firefox.  Two people are assigned to
ReleaseDuty every six weeks, preferably in different timezones to extend
available coverage.  There are specific days in a cycle when set tasks must be
done, such as creating a beta or release candidate, and other unscheduled work
that depends on issues that need fixing, and special requirements that specific
release might have.

ReleaseDuty is responsible for:
* Performing operational tasks for incoming Nightly, DevEdition, Beta, ESR, Release Candidate and final releases
* Merging repositories to create new beta, release candidates, releases and extended support releases.
* Coordinating with other teams, such as Release Management, Quality Engineering, Sheriffs, and other developers
* Fixing and improving the release automation, including both tools and processes
* Maintaining a logbook of issues and progress using releasewarrior.
* Arranging event post-mortems, if required.

The individual accountable for a release is known as the 'release owner',
and this is usually a specific member of Release Management.
