# MergeDuty Tasks

Tracking bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1407602

What's special about this migration:

Both m-r and m-b are being migrated on the same day. Thus combining the two weeks or migrations into one.

See https://github.com/mozilla/releasewarrior/blob/master/how-tos/mergeduty.md#appendix-what-to-do-if-relman-asks-1-release-to-be-on-2-trains-at-the-same-time for more details
